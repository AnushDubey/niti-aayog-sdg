# ML model on SDG score analysis based on NITI Aayog data
This project focuses on the analysis of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) scores for the years 2020-21, as provided by NITI Aayog, India. By leveraging data visualization and machine learning techniques, we aim to provide valuable insights that are crucial for shaping the government's sustainable development initiatives.

## Background and Significance
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), established by the United Nations in 2015, provide a comprehensive framework to address global challenges and promote sustainable development. NITI Aayog, India's apex policy institution, undertakes the crucial task of assessing the progress of states and union territories in achieving these goals. The SDG scores assigned by NITI Aayog are instrumental in guiding policy formulation, aiding resource allocation, monitoring ongoing initiatives, enabling global comparisons, and fostering public awareness. These scores play a pivotal role in shaping evidence-based decision-making, driving sustainable development efforts, and ensuring accountability in the pursuit of a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

## Project Overview
- Analyzed NITI Aayogâ€™s SDG 10, 11, and 12 datasets.
- Implemented data visualization and machine learning to derive insights.
- Achieved a 70% accuracy rate with a Linear Regression model.
- Validated the model with actual SDG scores, demonstrating its practical applicability for informing data-driven sustainable policies at a national level.
